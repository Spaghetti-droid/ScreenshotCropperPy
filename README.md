# ScreenshotCropper

Designate a screen or part of a screen, and take screenshots of that area that are saved automatically to a folder that you desgignated previously.

This is a complete remake in Python of the Java version of the project which can be found in the https://github.com/Spaghetti-droid/ScreenshotCropper and https://github.com/Spaghetti-droid/ScreenshotCropperGUI repositories.
